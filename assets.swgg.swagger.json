This can be used to modify the parameters of your app, create and manage test users, or read your apps's insights.\n\nLimitations\nSome user data that would normally be visible to an app that's making a request with an user access token isn't always visible with an app access token. If you're reading user data and using it in your app, you should use a user access token instead of an app access token.\n\nApp access tokens are considered insecure if your app is set to Native/Desktop in the Advanced settings of your App Dashboard and therefore will not work with API calls. This is because we assume that native or desktop apps will have the app secret embedded somewhere (and therefore the app access token generated using that secret is not secure).\n\nGenerating an App Access Token\nTo generate an app access token, you need to make a Graph API call:\n\nGET /oauth/access_token\n    ?client_id={app-id}\n    &client_secret={app-secret}\n    &grant_type=client_credentials\nThis call will return an app access token which can be used in place of a user access token to make API calls as noted above. Again, for security, app access token should never be hard-coded into client-side code, doing so would give everyone who loaded your webpage or decompiled your app full access to your app secret, and therefore the ability to modify your app. This implies that most of the time, you will be using app access tokens only in server to server calls.\n\nNote that because this request uses your app secret, it must never be made in client-side code or in an app binary that could be decompiled. It is important that your app secret is never shared with anyone. Therefore, this API call should only be made using server-side code.\n\nThere is another method to make calls to the Graph API that doesn't require using a generated app access token. You can just pass your app id and app secret as the access_token parameter when you make a call:\n\nhttps://graph.facebook.com/endpoint?key=value&access_token=app_id|app_secret\nThe choice to use a generated access token vs. this method depends on where you hide your app secret.\n\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/#apptokens\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/apps/",
